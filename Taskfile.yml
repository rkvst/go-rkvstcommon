# This Taskfile represents the primary control surface for developers interacting with
# this component.
#
# Primary "configure/build/deploy/test" tasks must be provided directly in this top level
# taskfile
#
# Infrequently used or pure sub-tasks should be in subservient taskfiles and included
# here.
#
# All tasks that are expected to be run directly by developers must have a meaningful
# 'desc' with all optional variables defined, in this file or in included files.
#
# All tasks that are internal sub-tasks only should have a meaningful 'summary'.
#
